# day-scheduler

This is a simple scheduler app, color coded depending on the time.

## Usage

You can input a task for each hour of the work day, from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. The rows are also color coded depending on when you look at your schedule. Hours that have already passed will be red, the current hour will be grey, and the hours yet to come will be green. Once you click the lock button, your task will be displayed and saved to local storage, so that they persist after refreshing. I also included a clear button to fix typos or clear finished tasks.
